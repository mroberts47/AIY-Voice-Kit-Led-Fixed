Three new libraries were added argparse, locale, and logging. All found through the AIY tutorials 
with updated libraries. 
Next from the aiy.board library the Board, LEd must be added which will further alter the code. 
The the original cloudspeech library is now the CloudSpeechClient. You must import the CloudSpeechClient from the aiy.cloudspeech.
The gpiozero is with in the Vioce kit already and you must import the LED from their.

The led pin is different amongst other boards depending on where the LED is plugged in. 
The code is now altered from the original code to match with the newly added libraries. 













All the work done fixing the code goes to Dr. Kropf and the Spring 2019 Sensors and Automation Class.
